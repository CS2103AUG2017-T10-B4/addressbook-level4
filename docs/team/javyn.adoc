=== Enhancement Added: Remark

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remark]


---

==== Justification

As admin staffs in companies usually deal with large group of personals, it would be convenient if they could add personal remarks for each of the contacts. For example, they could put remarks such as "owe project progress report" as a reminder for themselves.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---


include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]



---

==== Justification

For admin staff especially in the human resource department, there would usually be a large number of contacts being added at once. Thus, after the large group of contacts is being added with the add multiple contacts feature, the user is then able to properly sort the contacts in TheYellowPage in alphabetical order.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

=== Other contributions

Added occupation and website fields to Person (Pull requests https://github.com[#85], https://github.com[#58])

At the end of the enhancements, a person class will now contain fields inlcuding occupation, website and remark:

Since TheYellowPage is targeted towards office workers, having occupation and website field helps to identify the job position of each contact, along with their personal website such as facebook, linkedin or github.
