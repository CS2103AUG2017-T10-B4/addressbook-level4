==== Justification of 1st Enhancement

As TheYellowPage is designed with the typical office worker/Human Resource agent in mind, the features implemented are meant to make their work processes more efficient.

The original delete command only allows the user to delete one contact at a time. While feasible for the average user, it becomes a cumbersome process for the HR agent who has to deal with a massive number of contacts. 

The DeleteMultipleCommand feature allows HR agents to clear off multiple contacts off their company's address book quickly, without having to clear the entire list.
